Assembled from high-resolution scans of the original film frames, this one sweeps across the magnificent desolation of the Apollo 11 landing site on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility. The images were taken by Neil Armstrong looking out his window of the Eagle Lunar Module fifty years ago, shortly after the July 20, 1969 landing. The frame at the far left (AS11-37-5449) is the first picture taken by a person on another world. Toward the south, thruster nozzles can be seen in the foreground on the left, while at the right, the shadow of the Eagle is visible to the west. For scale, the large, shallow crater on the right has a diameter of about 12 meters. Frames taken from the Lunar Module windows about an hour and a half after landing, before walking on the lunar surface, were intended to initially document the landing site in case an early departure was necessary."

    "description": "The United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969. To date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted crewed missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972.\r\n\r\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.",

        "Description": "An eye movement-based methodology and assessment tool may be used to     quantify many aspects of human dynamic visual processing using a     relatively simple and short oculomotor task, noninvasive video-based eye     tracking, and validated oculometric analysis techniques. By examining the     eye movement responses to a task including a radially-organized     appropriately randomized sequence of Rashbass-like step-ramp     pursuit-tracking trials, distinct performance measurements may be     generated that may be associated with, for example, pursuit initiation     (e.g., latency and open-loop pursuit acceleration), steady-state tracking     (e.g., gain, catch-up saccade amplitude, and the proportion of the     steady-state response consisting of smooth movement), direction tuning     (e.g., oblique effect amplitude, horizontal-vertical asymmetry, and     direction noise), and speed tuning (e.g., speed responsiveness and     noise). This quantitative approach may provide fast and results (e.g., a     multi-dimensional set of oculometrics and a single scalar impairment     index) that can be interpreted by one without a high degree of scientific     sophistication or extensive training.",

        "patentName": "Comprehensive Oculomotor Behavioral Response Assessment (COBRA)",
        "Description": "Dynamic visual processing remains difficult to assess clinically, due at least in part to the lack of a readily-available assessment tool and a codified set of performance standards.  Severe impairments in dynamic visual function can stem from a large number of causes, including: stroke, traumatic brain injury, autism, Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, degenerative retinal disease, drug toxicity, aging, and spaceflight-induced visual impairment.  To assess various aspects of dynamic visual function including peripheral attention, peripheral spatial localization, perceptual motion processing, and oculomotor responsiveness, we developed a simple fifteen-minute clinical test that measures and computes ten eye-movement-based, i.e., oculometric, measures.  Our oculometric tool may be useful to clinicians to localize affected brain regions following trauma, degenerative disease, or aging, to characterize and quantify clinical deficits, to monitor recovery of function after injury, and to detect altered or impaired visual performance at sub-clinical levels.  This sensitive assessment tool has immediate applicability as a screening tool by comparing the oculometric measures of an individual to a normal baseline population, or from the same individual before and after exposure to a potentially-traumatic event (e.g., a boxing match, football game, combat tour, space mission), or on an ongoing basis to monitor performance as it returns to baseline following injury.  Applications of our oculometric tool include screening: patients for deficits in visual function; pilot candidates based upon inherent dynamic visual capabilities; patients, players, or soldiers for recovery by periodic reassessment following injury;  automobile drivers as they age; and astronaut visual status before and after a mission.",
